      "Aiden needs 80 meatballs for the cookout, and each meatball requires 2 tablespoons of seasoning. Therefore, he needs 80 x 2 = 160 tablespoons of seasoning. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, he needs 160/2 = 80 pounds of meat. He gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, so he needs 80 x 16 = 1280 meatballs. Therefore, he needs 1280/16 = 80 pounds of meat. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, he needs 80 x 2 = 160 tablespoons of seasoning.\n",

      "There are several ways to determine if a restaurant is popular among locals or mainly attracts tourists:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Look at the customer base: If the restaurant is always full of tourists, it is likely that it is mainly attracting tourists. If the restaurant is mostly filled with locals, it is likely that it is popular among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Check online reviews: Look at the reviews of the restaurant on websites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Google Reviews. If the reviews are mostly from tourists, it is likely that the restaurant is mainly attracting tourists. If the reviews are mostly from locals, it is likely that the restaurant is popular among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Ask locals: Ask locals in the area if they have been to the restaurant and if they recommend it. If they have not been to the restaurant or do not recommend it, it is likely that the restaurant is mainly attracting tourists.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Look at the menu: If the menu is mostly in a foreign language or has dishes that are not commonly found in the area, it is likely that the restaurant is mainly attracting tourists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing if a restaurant is popular among locals or mainly attracts tourists can be useful for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It can help you make informed decisions about where to eat. If you are looking for a restaurant that is popular among locals, it is likely that the food and atmosphere will be authentic and unique to the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. It can help you avoid tourist traps. If you are looking for a restaurant that is mainly attracting tourists, it is likely that the food and atmosphere will be overpriced and not representative of the local culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. It can help you support local businesses. If you choose to eat at a restaurant that is popular among locals, you are supporting the local economy and helping to preserve the local culture.\n",
