      "Gosh, it does seem like a weird habit for a cat to have, and yes, there are some things you can try to encourage him. It is important to keep in mind that each cat has his own unique personality, and some are just more particular than others.  The most important thing is to try to make the litter area as stress-free as possible for your cat, since stress could potentially be a cause.  For example, you should make sure to thoroughly clean the litter box frequently, provide a high quality litter, and choose the proper location.  You might also consider providing more than one litter box to stretch out the time between changes.  You can also carefully observe the cat’s behavior and habits to come up with ways to encourage him to cover his poop.  For example, you could place a treat under the poop when he exits the litter box to encourage him to return for the snack, and sprinkle dried catnip in the litter to reinforce desired behaviors.  If no other approach seems to be working, you may wish to consider consulting a veterinary professional, as cats can be sensitive to pain or health issues that may prevent them from covering their feces.  If you do so, be sure to mention any of the specific steps and tactics you’re attempting, as he or she will be able to provide specific recommendations based on your situation.  \n",
      "Hope this information has been helpful, and remember to never punish or yell at your cat if the behavior is troubling you.  Please do reach out to me again if I can be of any further assistance.\n",
      "Have a lovely day, and please let me know if you have any questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad Response:\n",
      "Greetings! This is a known problem with many cats and simple fixes can be very effective.  The key is to train the cat to associate covering the poop with something desirable, like food or a head rub!  Start by making a reward-based training regimen.  Sprinkle cat treats liberally in the litter box, and only after the cat has covered the poop.  Very quickly the cat will begin to understand that covering the poop is what gets it treats.  After training, you can gradually phase out the lavish use of treats, and soon he will instinctively cover his poop on his own!  My advice is to be very consistent and patient with this training, as this can take a while for your cat to fully understand. I hope this helps and your training is a success!  Best of luck, and please don't hesitate to reach out again with any other questions.\n"
